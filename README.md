# JS_projects-Beginner-
These are some of the easiest projects that I am doing for practice some core js elements.
I have embed Bootstrap in my HTML to have a Jumbotrone and use JS Dates to create a live clock

# If you don't want radiant color changing every time then simply remove 
<style>
      #time {
        animation: changeColor 1s infinite;
      }

      @keyframes changeColor {
        0% {
          color: red;
        }
        25% {
          color: green;
        }
        50% {
          color: blue;
        }
        75% {
          color: orange;
        }
        100% {
          color: red;
        }
      }
    </style>
